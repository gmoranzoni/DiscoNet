\title{MCODE Network Clustering}
\usage{
mcode(graph, D = 0.5, haircut = FALSE, fluff = FALSE, fdt = 0.8, loops = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An igraph object representing the network to be clustered.}

\item{D}{Numeric. Defines the vertex weight percentage for scoring vertices
during the clustering process. Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{haircut}{Logical. If TRUE, singly-connected nodes are removed from clusters. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{fluff}{Logical. If TRUE, expands the clusters by one neighbor shell outwards. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{fdt}{Numeric. Sets the cluster density cutoff for fluffing procedure. Defaults to 0.8.}

\item{loops}{Logical. Determines whether to include self-loops in the graph. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list containing clusters sorted by a computed score based on size and edge count.
  Each element of the list represents a cluster and contains vertex IDs belonging to that cluster.
}
\description{
This function applies the MCODE clustering algorithm to identify
  molecular complexes in protein interaction networks. It includes options for vertex
  weighting, cluster expansion, and more.
}
\details{
Clusters a network using the MCODE (Molecular Complex Detection) algorithm.
MCODE identifies densely connected regions in large protein interaction networks
that may represent molecular complexes.
